## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Information 

**Cows & Bulls**[^1] but with also more advantages, which I call **keys**.

#### Cows üêÑ
Cow is simply the `true` option. If you choosed a right option you'll get one cow.  
**You'll win the game by getting 4 cows.**

#### Bulls üêÇ
Bull is simply the `false` option. If you had a wrong choose you'll get one bull.

#### Keys üîë
Key is a special idea I added to the main idea, it's something in between both `true` & `false`.  
If you choosed a right option but at the same time it's not in the right place with makes it a "cow", so it'll give you a key.
###### The name implies that it is a key that makes it easier for you to solve the game and makes it more interesting at the same time.
